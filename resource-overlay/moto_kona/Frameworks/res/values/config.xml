    <!-- Power Management: Specifies whether to decouple the auto-suspend state of the
         device from the display on/off state.

         When false, autosuspend_disable() will be called before the display is turned on
         and autosuspend_enable() will be called after the display is turned off.
         This mode provides best compatibility for devices using legacy power management
         features such as early suspend / late resume.

         When true, autosuspend_display() and autosuspend_enable() will be called
         independently of whether the display is being turned on or off.  This mode
         enables the power manager to suspend the application processor while the
         display is on.

         This resource should be set to "true" when a doze component has been specified
         to maximize power savings but not all devices support it.

         When false, setInteractive(..., true) will be called before the display is turned on
         and setInteractive(..., false) will be called after the display is turned off.
         This mode provides best compatibility for devices that expect the interactive
         state to be tied to the display state.

         When true, setInteractive(...) will be called independently of whether the display
         is being turned on or off.  This mode enables the power manager to reduce
         clocks and disable the touch controller while the display is on.
